Join me for a roadtrip in the heart of Turkish Anatolia, where I explore the underground city of Derinkuyu and Kapadokya.

Day 1.

we start the journey in the mediterranean city of Mersin, I borrow my uncle's vehicle and we hit the beautiful road.

Starting in Mersin, we head out to Kapadokya region to meet with friends
Exploring the ruins across Goreme, Nevşehir, and everything in between.
Our planned journey looks something like this:

As we leave Mersin behind and cross into the Tausus Mountains, the landscapes dramatically transforms from the vibrant blues of the Mediterranean to the earthy tones of Anatolia.

Our journey takes us through many small villages. We decide to stop by one the town of Yesilgolcuk as we noticed a town market was happening.

After exploring this little market, we got pretty hungry so we found a local meat shop and had a delicious lunch.

Ottoman Sultans were known to [safeguard culinary methods and recipes](https://medium.com/exploring-history/food-that-conquered-the-world-the-ottoman-empire-3d58013e4ff2), and I can see why... Turkish food is outstanding and might be my favourite part of this country.

This lunch ran about 200 TRY (~$10 CAD). The exchange rate was definitely in our favour on this trip.

As we approach the Kapadokya region, we begin to notice hundreds of little caves along the road. These caves are belived to be dating back to the 7-8th centuries.

We finally arrive in the Kapadokya region. While many people assume Kapadokya is a city, it's actually more of a region comprised of valleys and small towns you can drive through.

![Uçhisar Castle](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/8-kapadokya.jpg)

A distinctive feature of the region are these "fairy chimney" rock clusters, shaped by centuries of volcanic activity and erosion in the region. It's quite an otherworldly landscape.

Many people like to take the hot air balloons up and see the valley from the skies. Today, it was too windy to do so.

![Hot air balloon](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/10-balloon.jpg)

We instead opt'd to go hike down to the valley and explore its many scattered caves. 

![Getting in some of these was a bit difficult](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/11-climbing-cave.jpg)

This one was an old (defaced) Christian church. Notice the face of Jesus scratched off and the faded red cross.

Here was a cave in much better condition, at the time of our visit it was being renovated.

We continue exploring the valley.

![Other worldly scene](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/13-landscape-valley.jpg)

From the ancient Hittite civilization to the early Christians seeking refuge in its caves, Kapadokya has been a crossroads of cultures and a canvas for human resilience. The layers of history are woven into every stone, making it a place where the past feels alive.

After some technical mishaps, we finally meet up with some friends. Turns out there's alot more of them than can fit in our little Fiat.

We make it work and drive up to Kayseri to drop them off at the airport.

![Way too many guys in the back](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/15-boys.jpeg)

After dropping off our friends at the Kayseri airport. We check in at the Radisson Blu Hotel. We chose this hotel because it features a Turkish bath/spa. Much needed after a long day of exploring.

Day 2

We wake up to a beautiful winter morning in the city of Kayseri. It looks like a typical large Turkish city with tons of similar large apartment buildings in grids.

![Your typical Turkish city](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/17-morning-kayseri.jpeg)

As we hit the town square, retired men are drinking Cay (Tea) and playing backgammon.

![Backgammon and tea](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/18-backgammon-tea.jpeg)
![Pigeons around the city center](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/27-pigeons.jpg)

We go for a simple turkish breakfast. Some Sucuklu Tost (Grilled cheese and turkish sausage) and Cay.

![Simple and delicious](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/19-breakfast.jpg)

Turkish people drink lots of tea. In Kayseri, a special variety we noticed many drinking is Oralet. A fruit flavoured tea. This one is Watermelon and Strawberry.

![Oralet](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/20-oralet.jpeg)

Looking to see what Kayseri has to offer, we go explore the Kayseri castle, dating back to 238 AD.

![Kayseri Castle walls](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/21-kayseri-castle.jpg)

![Ottoman map of Kayseri showing the castle (bottom) and surrounding landscape](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/22-kayseri-map.jpeg)

This castle has had many ups and downs throughout its history. It's had multiple cycles of being abandonded, used a slum, then internal demolition to get rid of the slum encampements. It wasn't until funding was made available in 2016 that a restoration project began creating a museum and showcasing the history of the castle inside.

The castle has many artisan workshops. This one is a traditional Ney maker. A turkish flute.

Before leaving Kayseri, we stop by a cured meat shop to pickup the local speciality, Pastırma.

![Pastırma](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/25-basturma.jpg)

On the itinerary for today is the underground city of Derinkuyu. 

We hit the road yet again, this time taking a scenic mountainous route. We catch a glimpse of the breathtaking Mount Erciyes.

![Mount Erciyes in the background](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/26-mount-erciyes.jpg)

The weather was perfect with clear skies, high visibility, and beautiful views.

![Valley road](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/29-road.jpg)

As we get closer to Derinkuyu we start to notice thousands of caves alongside the road.

![Little caves and homes along the hill](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/30-caves.jpg)

This region felt a bit eery as we hardly saw anyone in sight. These homes built into the hill we suspect were abandonded not too long ago.

![More homes built into the hill](/assets/imgs/article_imgs/turkey-roadtrip/31-caves.jpg)

Arrived.
